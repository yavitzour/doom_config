# doom_config
my doom emacs config

This is a config that uses two flavors of doom - one bloated with everything I might need, and the other thin and lean and can be started instantly. 
Switching between the profiles is done with chemacs2 (https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2).

More work should be done in merging the common configurations between the two profiles
